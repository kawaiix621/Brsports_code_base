# BRsport 
*BRsport is a web3-based matchmaking platform for mobile battle royale games. Players can join custom matches, compete, and earn tokens in a decentralized ecosystem.*

### Features:
- **Multi-Game** Support: Works with any mobile battle royale game (e.g., PUBG, Free Fire, Call of Duty Mobile).
- **Web3 Integration** Players use tokens for match access and rewards.
- **Room System** Join matches via a room ID and password.
  - Scalable Architecture: Built on Ethereum, with plans to migrate to Monad for higher throughput.*

### Tech Stack:
- **Smart Contracts:** Managed using Hardhat.

- **Frontend** React-based user interface.

- **Backend** Node.js for API and server logic.

### Blockchain:
- **Initial Deployment** Ethereum
- **Future Migration*** Monad (for scalability)

### Migration to Monad:

- Once Monad launches, the token and contract will be migrated to handle higher transaction throughput and lower fees. The steps will involve:

- **1.** Snapshotting token balances on Ethereum.


- **2.** Redeploying the contract on Monad.

- **3.** Offering a swap mechanism for users to transition tokens.
